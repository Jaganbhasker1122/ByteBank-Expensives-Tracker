## Development Notes

**Libraries Used**
- `customtkinter` ‚Äî modern UI components.
- `Pillow` ‚Äî image loading/processing.
- Standard libs: `json`, `os`, `uuid`, `datetime` for data handling.

**Error Handling**
- All major operations (login, account creation, add/update/delete/view transactions) are wrapped in `try-except` blocks to handle file I/O errors, invalid inputs, and other exceptions. User-friendly popup dialogs inform the user of success or failure.

**UI Consistency**
- A `CONFIG` dictionary centralizes colors, fonts, and sizes to keep the UI consistent across the app.

**Data Persistence**
- JSON files are used for simplicity, portability, and easy debugging ‚Äî suitable for desktop use.
